CSES Handbook : https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf 

This is THE BOOK.

You have everything in it, to get familiarised with the CP World.
From templates to STL,From greedy to DP, From Graphs to Trees. Everything.
(you will hear these words in a few days, so don't worry if this is the first time you are hearing of it)
Although it has everything, this book is mainly useful for familiarising yourself with CP, later on,
this won't be sufficient.

USACO Guide : https://usaco.guide/general/using-this-guide?lang=cpp 
USACO is USA computing olympiad, so this website has some stuff specific about those contests 
and their weird submission formats too, you can safely ignore that, leaving that this website is very good
